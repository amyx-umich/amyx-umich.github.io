# Amyx's Personal Site Template

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


Now `cd` to your project name and to start your project run 

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `docs`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
